(codeslinger.co.uk)[http://www.codeslinger.co.uk/pages/projects/gameboy.html]

(ThePixelPingu)[https://www.twitch.tv/thepixelpingu] for help moderninzing the original code

(Nintendo)[https://www.nintendo.com/] they made the original Game Boy.

And then there's me. The guy who took all of these people's great work, and probably screwed it all up = P 

# How To Use

It's a CLI program.

```
pangoboy rom
    As A nice test, I included the infamous space.gb test rom. (Don't know who made it, but props to who ever made it)
    Try running:
    pangoboy ROMS/space.gb
```

# How do it work?

Well the codeslinger original supposedly "has about 95% compatibility but with no sound.", and mine well... it works. It can run games. Not even *close* to perfect at all though.
It lures you in, looks alright

but then you realize all the sprites have solid backgrounds, or just flat out disappear; softlocking your game

ie in Kirby's Dreamland, the first miniboss flatout disappears and you cannot progress further.
